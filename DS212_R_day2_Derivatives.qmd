## Derivatives in R

```{r}
fx <- expression(3.1 * (x^4) - 28*x)
# --- store the derivative expression
df_dx <- D(fx, 'x')

# --- call the derivative expression to get the value of the function
df_dx

x <- 10

# --- return the slope of the function df_dx
# --- eval is required to evaluate a function at the given value
eval(df_dx)


```

### Find the slope of g(z) = 2x^3 - 10.5z^2  + 4.1 at z=3.6

```{r}
# --- Find the slope of g(z) = 2x^3 - 10.5z^2  + 4.1 at z=3.6
gz <- expression(2 * z^3 - 10.5 * z^2 + 4.1)
dg_dz <- D(gz,'z')

dg_dz

#z <- 3.6
#eval(dg_dz)

z = seq(from = 1, to = 3, length = 20)

eval(dg_dz)
```
Hello. Testing the changes in this doc.

```{r}
# --- Simple calc
a <- 1
b <- 2

a+b
```
